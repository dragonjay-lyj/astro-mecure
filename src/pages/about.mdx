Greetings, fellow traveler! ðŸ‘‹

## About me

An anonymous face in the online crowd, invisible in the offline world.
A coder by trade, an introvert by nature.

In the vast digital cosmos, I am but a speck of stardust.
If our paths happen to cross, remember that even the faintest light shone brightly once.

Yet to be jaded by the realities of the "real world," I'm currently navigating the trials and tribulations of graduate school, with the looming prospect of joining the workforce.

I'm an introvert at heart, finding solace in coding, music, lighthearted videos, and the immersive worlds of single-player games.

A jack of all trades, master of none. I dabble in a bit of everything but haven't quite found my niche. I enjoy experimenting and tinkering, though my creations rarely see the light of day.
