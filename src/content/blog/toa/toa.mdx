>He shoots, he scores, he shrugs with one hand in his pocket. Meet Yusuf Dikeç, the internet's newest obsession.

Every Olympics has its breakout stars, and this year in Paris, Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikeç has taken the internet by storm, not just for his skills, but for his effortlessly cool demeanor. Pictures of him casually winning a silver medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event, sporting a simple outfit and a nonchalant one-handed grip, have sparked a flurry of memes and fan art.

Netizens are captivated by his calm under pressure and his "too cool for school" vibe. The fact that his motto on the official Olympics website is "Success doesn't come with your hands in your pockets" adds another layer of irony, making him seem like a hidden master who stumbled onto the Olympic stage by accident.

Dubbed the "Zero-Charged Uncle" by Japanese fans and the "Regular Guy" by others, Yusuf's minimalist approach to gear, contrasting sharply with his heavily-equipped competitors, has only fueled the meme fire. He's become a symbol of effortless skill, proving that you don't need fancy gadgets to reach the top.

The internet, never one to miss a meme opportunity, has gone into overdrive. Fan art portrays him as a character from video games like "Persona 5" and "Devil May Cry 5." Someone even created a mod for "Tekken 8" featuring Yusuf, allowing gamers to experience his Olympic prowess firsthand.

But perhaps the most fitting meme is a photoshopped cover of the movie "John Wick" featuring Yusuf. His serious expression and military background (revealed by internet sleuths) have led to hilarious theories that he's a highly-trained assassin moonlighting as an Olympian.

While Turkish officials have debunked the hitman rumors, the internet's creativity knows no bounds. With each passing day, more memes and stories emerge, cementing Yusuf's status as the most unexpected star of the Paris Olympics.

This phenomenon highlights the power of the internet to connect people from all walks of life through humor and shared experiences. Even if we can't all be Olympic athletes, we can still find joy and camaraderie in celebrating those who embody the spirit of the Games, even if it's in the most unexpected ways.
