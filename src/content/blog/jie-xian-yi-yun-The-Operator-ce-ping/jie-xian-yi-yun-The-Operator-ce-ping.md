> Highly recommended... A case of beer + this game can give you a perfect night, like putting you in an X-Files story. Worth the price.

> The music is truly fantastic, and the sound is a very important factor in the puzzle-solving aspect of this game, so there is no forced skip function, which is very unfriendly to players like me who are on multiple playthroughs... ( ) It's really short, but I think short can sometimes be an advantage for a tabletop game... because this type of game is too easy to get tired of (like the si-something lacra next door). If the presentation is well done, I don't think it matters if it's a bit short~? Besides, the operating system is very comfortable, one of the best I've ever played in a tabletop game. & When I switched to the English version, I found that HAL always makes typos, is this some kind of hint?

> The plot is above average, as I could pretty much guess it by the second day. However, whoever came up with the idea of enhancing the sound effects with blurred vision deserves a raise - it elevates the entire game. It's impressive that such a small team can deliver such outstanding presentation and sound effects.

> This game is so much fun, it's just too short. The gameplay is full of surprises and unexpected twists that had me gasping. I was completely immersed and hope to see more games like this.

> ChaoticStupid

> Finally, a first-person detective game! I hope the atmosphere is dark and realistic enough.

> Finished it, really good! It took about 4 hours to complete, a great game. The only downside is that there is no Russian language option, but you can always use your phone to translate!

## Review

🕵️‍♀️ **My Opinion** 🕵️‍♂️

This text-heavy game demands considerable reading and incorporates light interaction through code input and bomb defusal. Currently, there's only one ending and four hidden Easter eggs, with no alternate endings triggered even after full collection.

🖥️ The game interface emulates the FBI (FDI in-game) experience, offering strong immersion. Players assume the role of an operator, utilizing computer software and analytical skills to resolve various incidents.

🔍 As the title suggests, this is a puzzle-solving game devoid of horror elements. Character relationships, initially clear, become increasingly complex, leaving even the protagonist's identity shrouded in mystery.

🧪 The inclusion of specialized elements like material analysis software, bomb disposal manuals, and occasional code inputs enhances the game's realism.

🔮 Both the beginning and ending hint at a larger narrative, with the developers expressing interest in a sequel should funding allow.

⏱️  The game lasts approximately 4 hours.

⭐ **Personal Rating: 7/10**

👍 **Recommendation Index: 4/5**

💰 **Price: If you're interested, you might want to wait for a sale. I think it's worth it at $3 or less.**

🧐 **As an avid player of suspense, reasoning, and puzzle games, I didn't have high expectations for this game at first.**

✨ **Advantages:**

* The puzzle design and cutscene presentation are quite interesting.
* The cutscenes are mysterious and serve the plot well.
* The foreshadowing and details are well-placed, with no obvious logical issues or bugs.
* The puzzles are well-designed and not too difficult.
* The gameplay is smooth.

💢 **Disadvantages:**

* Character dialogue cannot be fast-forwarded or skipped, you have to wait for the voice acting to finish.
* The game cannot be saved manually, only autosaves.
* The game does not pause when the settings menu is open.
* The game is relatively short.
