> Highly recommended····· A case of beer + this game can give you a perfect night, equivalent to putting you in an X-Files-like story. Worth the ticket price.

> The music is truly fantastic, and the sound should be considered a very important factor in the puzzle-solving of this game, so there is no forced skip function, which is very unfriendly to players like me who are running multiple playthroughs...（） It's really short, but I think shortness can occasionally be an advantage for tabletop games... because this type is too easy to get tired of (like the si-something-lacra next door). If the presentation is well done, I don't think it matters if it's a bit short～？ Also, the operating system is very comfortable, among the best I've played in tabletop games. & Switching to the English version, I found that HAL always makes typos, what's the hint? (.)

> The plot is medium to upper because I feel like I can guess it by the second day, but who came up with the idea of blurring the vision and enhancing the sound effects, which instantly elevated the whole game. It's amazing that such a small team can produce such outstanding performances and sound effects.

> This game is so much fun, it's just too short. The game is full of surprises and unexpected events that make you can't help but exclaim. I was completely immersed and hope there will be more games like this.

> Finally waiting for the first-person detective game! Hope the atmosphere is dark and real enough.

> Finished playing, it's really good! The process is about 4 hours, a great game. The downside is that there is no Russian, but you can translate it with your phone!

## Review

🕵️‍♀️ **My Opinion** 🕵️‍♂️

This text-based game requires a certain amount of reading and combines it with a small number of operations (entering code, defusing bombs). Currently, there is only one ending and 4 hidden easter eggs, even if you collect them all, it will not trigger a hidden ending.

🖥️ The game's operating interface simulates the FBI (FDI in the game), providing a strong sense of immersion. Players act as operators, helping to solve various problems through computer software and information analysis.

🔍 The game's name suggests that it is a puzzle game with no horror elements. The relationship between the characters is clear in the early stage, but becomes confusing in the later stage, and even the identity of the protagonist becomes a mystery.

🧪 Some of the professional elements in the game, such as material analysis software and bomb disposal manuals, as well as the occasional need to enter code, enhance the realism of the game.

🔮 Both the beginning and the end of the game hint at more content, and the official said that if there is enough funding, a second part will be made.

⏱️ The game takes about 4 hours to play.

⭐ **Personal rating: 7/10**

👍 **Recommendation index: 4/5**

💰 **Evaluation: Friends who want to buy it may want to wait a bit longer, I feel that 20 yuan or less is more appropriate.**

🧐 **As a player who has been deeply involved in suspense, reasoning, and puzzle games, I didn't have high expectations for this game at first.**

✨ **Advantages:**

* The puzzle design and cutscene presentation are quite interesting.
* The cutscene design is mysterious and serves the plot.
* The foreshadowing and details are in place, and there are no obvious logical problems or bugs.
* The puzzle design is good and the difficulty is not high.
* The game flow is smooth.

💢 **Disadvantages:**

* Character dialogue cannot be fast-forwarded or skipped and must wait for the voice to end.
* The game cannot be saved manually, only automatically.
* The game does not pause when opening the settings menu.
* The process is short.
