Following Apple's August 2nd earnings report and amidst speculation of a September 10th iPhone 16 launch, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman offered a scathing critique of the tech giant's recent performance. While acknowledging Apple's strong financial standing, Gurman lamented the company's "dramatically slowed" innovation. He argued that Apple has missed opportunities in emerging markets and scrapped promising internal projects, resulting in a stagnant product roadmap for the foreseeable future. "I don't see anything game-changing...until around 2027," Gurman declared.

Additionally, the company will halt dividend payments to shareholders, a practice in place since 1992, until cash flow stabilizes.

The US Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, alleging violations of children's privacy laws. The lawsuit, filed Friday and reported by Bloomberg, claims that TikTok failed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which mandates parental consent before collecting personal data from users under 13 years old.

Supported by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the lawsuit seeks to put an end to what the FTC calls TikTok's "illegal and massive invasion of children's privacy."
